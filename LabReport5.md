## Part 1: Debugging Scenario

**EsStemDiscussion**
> Misha: Hi, I am working on the autograding script from lab. I am having trouble getting it to work properly. I found there to be some kind of bug in my bash script but I can't seem to find it. The script works for most of the repositories we have to test our grader only it does not seem to work for the one that is supposed to be correct. From the output I believe it has something to do the last lines of my bash script where it calculates the student's score. I have tried changing the fields for `awk` but that doesn't seem to help, can anyone please help?

## Part 2: Reflection

In general I enjoyed learning about all the topics we discussed but somethings that stood out to me is when we learned how to write a bash grading script. We did this in class and in lab in week 6 and I liked learning about it because I feel like it is something that definetly correlated to something in my life. Before I did not know or think about how any work was graded but now I do and even learned how to write one myself. I learned the actual specific like what goes into the actual grading bash script but in general I also just liked learning about kind of what goes on behind the scenes of something I hadn't thought of before. Especially because having taken other cse courses I have definetly interacted with grading scripts before being used on my own programming, so I thought it was cool to learn about how something like that works and is built.

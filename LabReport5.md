## Part 2: Reflection

In general I enjoyed learning about all the topics we discussed but somethings that stood out to me is when we learned how to write a bash grading script. We did this in class and in lab in week 6 and I liked learning about it because I feel like it is something that definetly correlated to something in my life. Before I did not know or think about how any work was graded but now I do and even learned how to write one myself. I learned the actual specific like what goes into the actual grading bash script but in general I also just liked learning about kind of what goes on behind the scenes of something I hadn't thought of before. Especially because having taken other cse courses I have definetly interacted with grading scripts before being used on my own programming, so I thought it was cool to learn about how something like that works and is built.
